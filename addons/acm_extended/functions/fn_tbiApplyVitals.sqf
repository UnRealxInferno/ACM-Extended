// and CPP state instead of sitting normal. it is phased, and everything scales with ICP severity, compensation
// and the herniation stage.
// compensated cushing, where ICP is at or above the trigger and the reserve is intact, gives malignant
// hypertension with a widened pulse pressure, so the systolic climbs far more than the diastolic, plus reflex
// bradycardia and irregular, cheyne-stokes respirations. the brain is defending CPP. it is ominous and holding.
// decompensating, where the compensation budget is spent or herniation is advancing, is where the surge fails.
// the pressure falls, the pulse pressure narrows, hr slides toward agonal and respirations go ataxic.
// terminal herniation, at stage 3 with bilateral fixed pupils, gives pressure collapse, agonal bradycardia and
// apnea, so SpO2 falls out through ACM's own oxygen sim, then a forced cardiac arrest, which is real damage.
// dysautonomic instability means hr, bp and rr oscillate, through lundberg plateau waves and cheyne-stokes, with
// the amplitude growing as the patient destabilizes, so the numbers never sit still. hr is published to the
// sole-writer wrapper and nudged directly, so it moves even when ACM is not actively ticking the vitals of this
