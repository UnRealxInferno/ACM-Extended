// elevated head and the two systems fight over one body. ours loses silently and the pose sticks.
// this watches the animation itself, so it does not matter how or why ACM decided to move them.
// there are two different answers, because these are two different situations.
// the recovery position cancels the elevation outright. rolling someone onto their side is the airway intervention,
// and propping their head on a plate carrier while they lie on their side is not a position, it is two half-done
// things. it is one or the other.
// everything else suspends. CPR, lying flat and the continuous poses: the medic still wants the head up, they
// simply cannot have it while this is happening. the head goes down with the release animation, the carrier is set
// on the ground superior to the head so nothing clips through it, and it all comes back when the maneuver
// finishes.
// either way our animation goes first. ACM is free to roll and flip afterwards.
